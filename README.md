##### Summary

Three business recommendations that I would have would be first to offer incentives in Rural or Suburban cities to see if there is any room to be able to boost the revenue made. The second, would be to ramp up marketing in Urban cities because the revenue is currenty there and the marketing would attract additional riders. The third to raise the average fare in Urban cities to boost revenue.
